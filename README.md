Rock Paper Scissors Game for the Odin Project

This is the Rock Paper Scissors project from the Javascript Basics unit of the Odin Project's Foundations Course.

The aim of the project is to demonstrate the ability to build a program from scratch using basic Javascript commands and functions.

The current script goes beyond what was called for by the project brief. The brief required only that five rounds of the game be played. This was interpreted as a "best of five" game, so a function was written that plays rounds until one player, the user or the computer, scores three points. Additionally, the brief only required that the game be played in the browser's Javascript console, but additional prompts and alerts were programmed to enhance the game experience. The program will be updated in the future to add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.
